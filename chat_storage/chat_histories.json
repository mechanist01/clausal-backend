There are a few potentially relevant sections:\n\n1. Section 2.1 states that the contractor's \"sole compensation\" is the fees specified in the Statement of Work, which indicates commissions are based solely on net sales revenue generated. However, it does not address refunds/chargebacks.\n\n2. Section 3.5 allows the client to indemnify itself via deductions from payments due to the contractor for things like tax liabilities created by the contractor's actions. But this does not cover refunds/chargebacks.\n\n3. The Statement of Work states the contractor receives \"20% commission on the gross margin of your net sales revenue.\" This implies commissions are paid only on revenue that remains after deducting costs of goods sold. But it does not mention deducting refunds occurring after the sale.\n\nSince the contract does not explicitly permit or prohibit deducting refunds from commissions, it appears to be silent on that issue. Without clear contractual language allowing it, the client likely cannot unilaterally deduct refunds from the contractor's earned commissions.
