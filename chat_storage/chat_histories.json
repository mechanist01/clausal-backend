After carefully reviewing my contractor agreement, I do not believe there is a contractual basis for such deductions to be taken from my pay.\n\nSpecifically, Section 4.1 of the agreement states that my compensation \"shall be based on the compensation terms set forth in Exhibit A.\" The contract does not appear to authorize any further deductions beyond those agreed terms in Exhibit A. Additionally, Section 5.2 makes me responsible only for \"expenses incurred while performing Services\" which would exclude refunds issued to customers.\n\nImportantly, the contract lacks any clause explicitly permitting Tribe Wellness to deduct amounts from my compensation to cover the costs of refunds issued to customers. Without such an expressly stated contractual right, the default legal position is that my compensation should follow the terms laid out in Exhibit A without unauthorized deductions.\n\nWhile I understand the need to refund customers who are dissatisfied, based on my reading of the agreement, there does not appear to be a clear basis for Tribe Wellness to unilaterally deduct those refund amounts from the compensation owed to me as an independent contractor. My compensation should be paid per the agreed terms.\n\nTherefore, I am respectfully requesting that any refund amounts deducted from my pay to date be returned to me in full. Going forward, I expect that my compensation will be paid according to Exhibit A without deductions for customer refunds, unless explicit authorization for such deductions exists elsewhere in our agreement that I have missed.\n\nI am happy to discuss this issue further. Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns. I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.\n\nThank you,\n[Your Name]", "timestamp": "2024-11-25T23:26:40.303166", "contractReference": null}, {"id": "1732595492.923432", "role": "assistant", "content": "Based on my review of the contract, there does not appear to be any provision that would allow the Client (Tribe Wellness Sales, Inc.) to terminate your services with 0 notice if you have not violated the termination clauses.\n\nThe key relevant section is Section 7 \"Term and Termination\":\n\n1) Section 7.1 establishes the initial term of the agreement, but does not address termination notice requirements.\n\n2) Section 7.2 lays out the specific circumstances under which either party can terminate the agreement, including things like material breach, insolvency, etc.\n\n3) Importantly, Section 7.2(b) states that for termination by the Client without cause, they must provide \"at least thirty (30) days prior written notice.\"\n\nSo the contract explicitly requires the Client to give you at least 30 days written notice if they wish to terminate without you violating one of the termination causes laid out in 7.2(a).\n\nThere does not appear to be any clause or language that would allow the Client to terminate the agreement with 0 notice if you have not breached or violated the agreement in a way that triggers one of those termination causes.\n\nThe 30 day written notice requirement in 7.2(b) seems to be the controlling provision regarding the notice period required for termination without cause by the Client.\n\nUnless I am missing something, based on the termination provisions in Section 7, the Client would not be able to fire you or terminate the agreement with 0 notice if you have not violated any of the termination causes laid out. They would still be required to provide the 30 day written notice per 7.2(b).\n\nSo in summary, no, the contract does not appear to permit the Client to fire you with 0 notice if you have not triggered any of the agreement violation reasons that could justify termination under Section 7.2(a).

You could seek compensation for:\n   - Income/payments you would have received during the 30 day notice period\n   - Other foreseeable damages from the improper termination\n   - Potentially attorney's fees if allowed under the contract\n\n3) Request a temporary restraining order or injunction from a court to prevent them from improperly terminating you without following the contractual terms.\n\n4) For services contracts, some states allow contractors to pursue statutory claims and penalties against companies that improperly terminate in violation of the agreement.\n\nThe key would be to demonstrate that you did not violate any of the termination causes in 7.2(a) that would allow termination without notice.

The amount would depend on your expected earnings during that 30-day period.\n\n2) Principle of the Matter\nBeyond just financial damages, you may want to pursue this on principle if you believe they violated the clear termination notice requirements in the contract. This could discourage them from improperly terminating other contractors.\n\n3) Deter Future Violations\nTaking legal action and securing a ruling that they breached the agreement may help prevent them from violating other provision with you or other contractors in the future.\n\n4) Attorneys' Fees Potential\nMany contracts have a provision allowing the prevailing party in a legal dispute to recover their attorneys' fees. If your agreement has such a clause, it could make pursuing this more financially viable.\n\nThe potential downside is the time, effort, and legal fees required to pursue a breach of contract claim or arbitration. You'd have to decide if the potential recovery is worth those costs.\n\nMy recommendation would be to first consult with a local attorney who handles contract disputes. Many offer free initial consultations. They can review your full agreement and situation to evaluate:\n\n1) The merits of your potential breach of contract claim\n2) An estimated value of your financial damages \n3) The legal fees and costs you're likely to incur\n4) The likelihood of actually recovering damages/fees from the company\n\nAn experienced attorney's assessment will allow you to make an informed decision about whether moving forward with legal action is worthwhile and justifiable.\n\nIf the potential damages recover would make it financially viable, and you want to pursue this matter on principle, then it could be worth taking legal action over their failure to provide proper written notification before terminating you. But getting an expert evaluation first would be very prudent.\n\nUltimately, it comes down to weighing the anticipated damages recovery against the legal costs required to pursue a breach of contract claim.

But the lack of explicit language would seem to weigh in your favor.\n\nMy recommendation would be to push back against any attempted refund/chargeback deductions from your commissions by citing the absence of any supportive language in Section 3 or elsewhere. You could argue you are entitled to the full commissions based on the \"Net Sales\" you generated per Section 3.1.\n\nAlternatively, you could propose adding an amendment to the agreement that specifically addresses refunds/chargebacks if the Company wants that flexibility. But I would not recommend agreeing to any unilateral deductions without a contractual provision clearly authorizing it.\n\nIn summary - while it's a bit ambiguous, the stronger argument based on the existing contract language is that the Company cannot deduct refunds or chargebacks from your earned commission payments under this agreement. The lack of any explicit provision giving them that right weighs in your favor.
